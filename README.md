## Project Outline

The mainstream operating systems mentioned in the previous section are extremely complex with millions of lines of code and have fixed designs for the sake of backwards compatibility. As a result, these operating systems are not used to teach undergraduate courses. Instead, there are operating systems written to be used in an educational context, such as MINIX and xv6. However, they do not support modern hardware and are often no longer maintained.
This project aims to investigate the process of creating an operating system that supports modern hardware to help me understand more about computer architectures and operating systems. Other beneficiaries of this project would be university students as they can learn about the mechanisms used by modern operating systems that are not utilised in older educational operating systems.
