# cOS

## Background

I have recently started taking an interest in the low-level implementation details of operating systems for computers. The operating system is system software that manages the computer system and provides services to programs. It consists of a kernel that has full control of the computer system and other loadable modules such as a networking layer.
Some of the responsibilities of the kernel include:

- Managing physical memory
- Managing virtual address spaces (paging)
- Scheduling and switching between programs
- Handling hardware and software interrupts
- Setting up architecture-specific structures
- Loading programs in and out of memory


Currently there are only a few mainstream operating systems: Microsoft Windows, macOS and Linux. Each of these operating systems are over 20 years old and are well supported by most commercial software.


## Project Outline

The mainstream operating systems mentioned in the previous section are extremely complex with millions of lines of code and have fixed designs for the sake of backwards compatibility. As a result, these operating systems are not used to teach undergraduate courses. Instead, there are operating systems written to be used in an educational context, such as MINIX and xv6. However, they do not support modern hardware and are often no longer maintained.
This project aims to investigate the process of creating an operating system that supports modern hardware to help me understand more about computer architectures and operating systems. Other beneficiaries of this project would be university students as they can learn about the mechanisms used by modern operating systems that are not utilised in older educational operating systems.

## Project Specification

These are checkboxes, but I will probably only review these guidlines at the end to check them off, rather than iteratively during the project. These are mostly for my own reference.

## Design

My project will be to create an operating system (cOS) that runs on modern hardware and is able to run user-space programs. The project will consist of the following sections:

- The core kernel that is responsible for initialising and managing the processor; handing hardware operations and memory; executing and switching between processes; and providing services to processes.
- The filesystem layer that is responsible for providing a virtual filesystem interface for processes to access files in a concrete filesystem agnostic manner.
- The networking layer that is responsible for managing network operations and sockets by interfacing with the network card driver and managing various networking protocol stacks.
- The user-space in which most user programs execute with C Library support. This is separated from the kernel using the protection mechanisms provided by the processor.

### Target Architecture

The instruction set architecture which generally defines how software controls the computer processor. Although most architectures have a similar processing model, with interrupt and virtual memory support, they also have differences that mean they are not interoperable. They also have different machine code instructions (instruction sets) so must be recompiled with different binaries targeting different architectures. The x86 is the most used computer architecture in the world, with the x86-64 being the modern 64-bit adaptation that is supported by most mainstream operating systems. This architecture, as a result, has extensive documentation and has two systems programming manuals written for it: the Intel manual and the AMD manual. This makes it a suitable choice for an investigative project into modern operating systems. Another contender is the ARM 64-bit architecture (AArch64 or ARM64). This is a newer architecture that is most commonly used in mobile applications. There is not as much documentation available for the ARM architecture and it is not as widely used for desktop personal computers. As a result, we target the x86-64 architecture for our operating system.

### Cross Compilation

The default system compilers make assumptions about the host machine (the machine that the program will run on), such as whether it has support for dynamic loading and whether it is freestanding. As a result, we must compile our own cross- compiler.
A cross-compiler is a compiler where the host machine (machine that the binaries will execute on) is different from the build machine (machine that compiles the binaries). Our host machine will be running cOS, however we do not have a compiler to build cOS! We make a generic cross-compiler that targets a generic x86-64 machine with no operating system in order to build our operating system. We use `gcc` as our compiler, and our host machine is `x86-64-elf` (we can eventually create our own toolchain and our host machine will be `x86-64-cos`). We will also build this using a Docker container, as this allows our build process to be easily reproducible by anyone. A deep dive into the build process is beyond the scope of this documentation.

### Hierarchy Charts (In Progress)

We show hierarchy charts for each part of the operating system, followed by a table describing the function of each module.
